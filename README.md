RELEASE 
Well, time to release this since it's useless to me.

INFO
RoNet / RBX.NET is a ROBLOX Cookie Based Stresser that sends HTTP GET requests to websites / IPs. It only hits websites, don't expect it to down home connections. This project works by making a lot of places on ROBLOX really quickly, and sending HTTP GET requests with them.

WHY
It is entierly watered down (ROBLOX limited to 1k REQ / game) so this thing would require an almost full re-write.
I'm releasing this to the ones who are dedicated, and will find workarounds.

also this is the first unedited version
